L means learning

Going to start on this:

https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/9f643d8dbf678430bc6707f0e5b914d0bf62545c/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md

Still don't know how the consensus stuff comes into play, eg lighthouse prysm, and how it all works together, but now a better understanding of how validators work on a high level.

Day3 try to understand the lower level of beacon chain and how all the other consensus clients interact with it later.
